# predict_next_word_app

This is an application is application predicting the next word based on previously typed words/phrases.  
Such application will facilitate typing on smart phone.  
This application was built for the final Capstone project of the "Data Science Specialization" of Jons Hopkins University on Coursera.  

The algorithm used to make the prediction is built based on the Coursera-Swiftkey dataset.  
The dataset is from a Corpus that collected corpora from publicly available sources (i.e. blogs, news, twitter) by a web crawler  
(click [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project/supplement/4phKX/about-the-copora) for more information).
